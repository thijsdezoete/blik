## Understanding Ratings

### Rating Scale

The standard 1-5 scale corresponds to the **Dreyfus Model**:

| Rating | Level | Description | What This Means |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **5** | Expert | Intuitive mastery, teaches others, innovates | You're a recognized leader in this area, setting standards for others |
| **4** | Proficient | Strong performance, independent, handles complexity | You consistently perform well and handle challenging situations effectively |
| **3** | Competent | Solid performance, meets expectations reliably | You're doing your job well and meeting expected standards |
| **2** | Advanced Beginner | Developing, needs occasional guidance | You're learning and improving but need support in this area |
| **1** | Novice | Requires significant development and support | This is a clear development area requiring focused effort |

### What "Good" Looks Like

**Don't expect all 5s:**
- 3s mean you're meeting expectations (this is positive!)
- 4s mean you're exceeding expectations
- 5s mean you're exceptional (rare)

**Healthy range:** Most people average between 3.5-4.5 across all areas
- Below 3.0 - Significant development needed
- 3.0-3.5 - Solid performance with room to grow
- 3.5-4.5 - Strong performance
- Above 4.5 - Exceptional performance

### Comparing Across Categories

**Self vs. Others:**
- Small differences (±0.5) are normal
- Large gaps (±1.0+) indicate perception differences worth exploring

**Peer vs. Manager:**
- Different perspectives are valuable
- Manager may weight strategic impact more heavily
- Peers may focus on day-to-day collaboration

**Direct Reports:**
- Focus on leadership and support behaviors
- May differ from peer feedback if you show up differently as a leader

## Perception Gap Analysis

### What is a Perception Gap?

A perception gap occurs when your self-assessment differs significantly from how others rate you.

### Types of Perception Gaps

#### 1. Imposter Syndrome Pattern
**Self ratings < Others' ratings**

**What it looks like:**
- You rate yourself 3, others rate you 4-5
- Gap of 1.0 or more points

**What it means:**
- You may be underestimating your impact
- You're more capable than you give yourself credit for
- Classic "imposter syndrome" - common among high achievers

**What to do:**
- Acknowledge your strengths and accomplishments
- Accept positive feedback graciously
- Build self-confidence through evidence of success
- Discuss with your manager to calibrate your self-view

#### 2. Overconfidence Pattern
**Self ratings > Others' ratings**

**What it looks like:**
- You rate yourself 4-5, others rate you 3 or below
- Gap of 1.0 or more points

**What it means:**
- Possible blind spot - you may not see how you're perceived
- Your impact may be less than you believe
- Others may have different expectations

**What to do:**
- Seek specific examples of the gap areas
- Ask for coaching on how to improve
- Be open to feedback and adjust your self-perception
- Focus on observable behaviors and results

#### 3. Aligned Perception
**Self ratings ≈ Others' ratings**

**What it looks like:**
- Ratings within ±0.5 points across categories

**What it means:**
- You have accurate self-awareness
- Good calibration with how others see you
- Strong foundation for development

**What to do:**
- Continue building on this self-awareness
- Use the aligned view to identify growth areas
- Model this self-awareness for others

### Severity Levels

**Moderate Gap (0.5-1.0 points):**
- Common and usually not concerning
- May reflect different perspectives or contexts
- Worth noting but not urgent

**High Gap (1.0-1.5 points):**
- Significant perception difference
- Warrants discussion with manager
- Should inform development priorities

**Severe Gap (1.5+ points):**
- Major disconnect in perception
- Requires immediate attention
- May indicate broader issues to address

## Getting Support

- **Mentor or Coach** - External perspective and guidance
- **Peers** - Peer learning and accountability

### When to Seek Help

- **Overwhelming feedback** - Too much to process alone
- **Emotional reactions** - Feeling defensive, hurt, or demoralized
