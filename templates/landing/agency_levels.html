                    <h3>Managers Aren't Bottlenecks</h3>
                    <p>When everyone operates at Level 1-2, managers become overwhelmed with trivial decisions. Level 4+ employees free up management bandwidth for strategic work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Faster Problem Resolution</h3>
                    <p>Level 5 employees fix issues immediately instead of creating multi-day email chains. Problems get solved in hours, not weeks.</p>

                    <h3>Better Context in Decisions</h3>
                    <p>The person closest to the problem usually understands it best. Level 4+ employees leverage that proximity to make smarter choices.</p>

                    <h3>Culture of Ownership</h3>
                    <p>Teams full of Level 4+ people don't have bystander syndrome. Everyone takes responsibility for outcomes, not just their narrow job description.</p>

                    <h3>Scales with Growth</h3>
                    <p>A team of 10 Level 1 employees needs 3 managers. A team of 10 Level 5 employees might need one. High agency scales better than headcount.</p>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>Attracts Top Talent</h3>
                    <p>High performers hate working with people who just report problems. They want teammates who solve things. Level 4+ culture becomes a recruiting advantage.</p>

                <p>The <a href="{% landing_url 'dreyfus_model' %}" style="color: var(--primary); text-decoration: none; font-weight: 500;">Dreyfus model</a> describes how people acquire skills (Novice → Advanced Beginner → Competent → Proficient → Expert). The 5 Levels of Agency describe how people approach problems and take ownership.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">You can be technically Expert but operate at Level 1 if you lack ownership mindset. Conversely, a Novice can operate at Level 4 by researching thoroughly and making recommendations within their knowledge constraints.</p>

                    <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> "I'm new to React, but I researched this state management bug. Based on the docs and Stack Overflow, I think we should lift state to the parent component. Can you review my approach?"</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">Limited technical skill, but high agency in problem-solving approach.</p>

                    <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> "The microservices architecture has a latency problem." <em>(Then waits for someone else to investigate)</em></p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">Deep technical expertise, but low ownership mindset. Surprisingly common in large companies.</p>

                    <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> "Database queries were slow. Added indexes on the foreign keys, reduced query time by 80%. Deployed to prod. Monitoring shows it's stable."</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">Solid technical skills combined with full ownership. This is what high-performing teams are built on.</p>

                    <p><strong>What it looks like:</strong> "Noticed a pattern of slow queries across multiple services. Implemented a caching layer, updated query patterns, added monitoring. Performance improved 10x. Documented the approach for other teams."</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">High technical skill + high agency + systems thinking. These people multiply team effectiveness.</p>

                <h3>The Ideal Combination</h3>
                <p>In performance reviews, you want to evaluate both dimensions:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>Technical skill (Dreyfus):</strong> How good are they at their craft?</li>
                    <li><strong>Agency level:</strong> How proactively do they solve problems?</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A Competent engineer with Level 5 agency is often more valuable than an Expert with Level 2 agency. Skills can be taught faster than ownership mindset.</p>

                <h3>Measuring What Matters</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Traditional performance reviews miss agency entirely. They measure "what" someone does (features shipped, tickets closed) but not "how" they do it (Level 1 vs Level 5 approach).</p>
                <p>Blik's questionnaires explicitly ask reviewers: Does this person identify problems and walk away, or do they drive solutions? The difference between a team of Level 1 and Level 5 employees is the difference between constant firefighting and smooth execution.</p>

                    <h3>1. Set Clear Expectations</h3>
                    <p>Tell new hires explicitly: "You operate at Level 4 minimum. When you spot a problem, I expect you to come with diagnosis and recommendations, not just alerts."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>2. Reject Level 1 Behavior</h3>
                    <p>When someone reports a problem without context, don't solve it for them. Ask: "What do you think is causing this? What solutions have you considered?" Make them level up.</p>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>3. Reward Level 5 Actions</h3>
                    <p>When someone solves a problem autonomously, praise it publicly. "This is exactly what high agency looks like." Make it clear this is the standard.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>4. Provide Safety Nets</h3>
                    <p>People won't operate at Level 5 if they get punished for mistakes. Make it safe to act, fail, learn. The cost of occasional errors is lower than the cost of learned helplessness.</p>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3>5. Give Incremental Trust</h3>
                    <p>Start new people at Level 4 (recommendations need approval). As they prove judgment, move them to Level 5 (act first, inform later). Earned autonomy works better than blanket permissions.</p>

                    <h3>6. Model It Yourself</h3>
                    <p>If you as a manager operate at Level 1 with your own boss, your team will mirror that. Show them what Level 5 looks like by doing it yourself.</p>
